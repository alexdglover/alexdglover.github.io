I"*<p>For those of you out there planning a wedding, you may have thought about setting up a website. Something to answer those common questions guests may have so that you can focus on all of the other aspects of wedding planning. There are some pretty slick WYSIWYG sites out there like <a href="http://www.weddingwire.com">Wedding Wire</a>, <a href="http://www.theknot.com/" target="_blank">The Knot</a>, and <a href="http://www.weddingchannel.com/" target="_blank">Wedding Channel</a> if you want to use a pre-built theme and just punch in your relevant information.</p>
<p>My wife and I couldn't find a theme and a site that fit our needs perfectly so I ended up building one for us.  <a href="http://alexdglover.github.io/cassieandalexwedding/index.html" target="_blank">Check it out</a> or see the screen shot below.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.alexdglover.com/assets/WeddingSiteScreenshot.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-593" alt="Screenshot of wedding web site" src="/assets/WeddingSiteScreenshot-1024x485.png" width="620" height="293" /></a></p>
<p>The site is built with <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/" target="_blank">Bootstrap 2</a> to provide the responsive framework and base CSS, <a href="http://galleria.io/" target="_blank">Galleria</a> for the photo gallery. I used PHP so I could re-use the header code on the other pages. If you're looking at the site on your computer (as opposed to phone/tablet), go to the accommodations or schedule page and try re-sizing your browser to make it smaller - you'll see the two-column layout collapse into a mobile-friendly single column layout.</p>
<p>Anyway, this is less of a tutorial post and more of a "use my code if it will help you jump start your project."</p>
