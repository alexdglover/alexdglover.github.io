I"µ<p>The Audible Eye is a short proof-of-concept project that I came up with while looking for ways to experiment with some new gear. The idea of combining an ultrasonic rangefinder and some sort of signaling audio output jumped out to me - it would give you a depth perception, not unlike echo location that bats and dolphins use. As far as practical use, I believe it could be used by the visually impaired as a complement to a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_cane" target="_blank">white cane</a>,Â but not asÂ a replacement.</p>
<p>Basically, the tone/pitch of the audio signal would get higherÂ as the operator moves closer to a wall or object, indicating to the operator that they are getting closer. Similarly, as the operator moves away from the wall the tone will drop until it's almost inaudible.</p>
<p>Let me provide some context to make this more clear. Let's imagine our operator is blindfolded. If the operator pointed the device down an empty hallway for example, they would hear almost no tone, telling them it's safe to walk forward. As they approached a wall, the tone would increase. The operator would then scan around them with the device, find another path that was unobstructed, and could continue walking.</p>
<p>This video is all but unwatchable (quality is IMPRESSIVELY<i>Â </i>bad), but it will at least give you an idea of how it works. And of course I disassembled the project before I realized the video was botched.</p>
