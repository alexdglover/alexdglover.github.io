I"À<p>WordPress has served me well over the years, but itâ€™s time for me to move on. My blog first started with Wordpress.com hosting, but I didnâ€™t like that I was hosting WPâ€™sÂ ads, Â a custom domain was an up-charge, and they limitÂ whichÂ themes and plugins I couldÂ use. So I migrated to a self-hosted WordPress instance, allowingÂ me to serve Google ads, add membership functionality, and allow people to subscribe to my site byÂ email.</p>
