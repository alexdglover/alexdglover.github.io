I"<p>The Raspberry Pi makes a great HTPC or media PC, whatever you want to call it, because of its low cost, low power consumption, quiet, and small form factor. As I was getting ready to start my Raspberry Pi build, I realized that the Pi could take over a few other functions that my desktop does, including NAS,Â at a fraction of the cost (see my previous post about <a title="Powering a Raspberry Pi" href="http://www.alexdglover.com/powering-a-raspberry-pi/">Powering a Pi</a> and related utility savings). But could I modify a RaspXBMC build to also run Samba or some other network file sharing? Could XBMC be installed on Raspbian with less than a thousand calls to aptitude? Could XBMC and Samba run simultaneously on a Pi without making video playback unwatchable? That's what I hoped to find out.</p>
<p>For context, I started with a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008XVAVAW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B008XVAVAW&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=alexdgloverwo-20" target="_blank">Raspberry Pi starter kit</a> from Amazon. For storage, I am using a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004IYJX16/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004IYJX16&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=alexdgloverwo-20" target="_blank">Fantom 2TB external hard drive</a>. After some preliminary research, I decided to start with Raspbian and try to install XBMC on top. For this walk-through, I'll assume you've got your Raspberry Pi powered, connected to your router, and that you have gotten Raspbian installed.

<h2>Part 1 - NAS</h2>
<h3>Part 1.1 - NTFS-3G</h3>
<p>If you don't plan to use NTFS as your filesystem for your Pi storage, you can skip this step!</p>
<p>If you do want to use NTFS, and you want to be able to read AND write to the drive, you need to install NTFS support:</p>
