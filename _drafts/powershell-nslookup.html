<p>I'm not a fan of Windows but PowerShell made my life a lot easier. I'm generally an advocate of PowerShell - it's not perfect, but it's a huge step forward from Windows command prompt and VB scripts.</p>
<p>PowerShell has a module for almost every basic function a sysadmin could ask for. Except nslookup. Which is ridiculous.</p>
<p>Some of the more clever folks who are reading this will suggest I use [System.DNS.client]. That's great, but in my case System.DNS.Client returned different values (which I still can't figure out) and won't let you specify which DNS servers to use.</p>
