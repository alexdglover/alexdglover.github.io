<p>I recently checked my WordPress stats, and I'm starting to get a fair amount of traffic for a personal, unadvertised blog.</p>
<p>But I'm not satisfied with that.</p>
<p>One of the WordPress traffic reports include the search criteria that lead visitors to my site. I can tell based on the search criteria that some of them didn't get the answer they were looking for. For example, someone searched "tamiya 4-speed double gear box" and ended up at my blog. I assembled one of those as part of my Heat Seeking Robot project, but didn't provide details as that wasn't the focus of the project. But I would provide a how-to, if someone asked :)</p>
<p>So I ask again - if you have a project, or a question, please feel free to comment on the blog or email me. I started this blog as a way to help others with their projects, as well as find some interesting puzzles for me to solve.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
