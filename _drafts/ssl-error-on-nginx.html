<h2>Change below text, this is just a reminder</h2>
<p>seen on Docker registry:</p>
<p class="p1">tls: oversized record received with length 28012</p>
<h2>ssl_error_rx_record_too_long on nginx</h2>
<div class="message">
<p>Today I encountered a problem with nginx that was caused by "long" ssl keys. Our old keys had a length of just 1024 bits, but the new ones had 2048 which introduced a problem. In firefox the error "ssl_error_rx_record_too_long" showed up. In chrome "Error 107 (net::ERR_SSL_PROTOCOL_ERROR)" appeared.</p>
<div></div>
<div>The solution is really simple, if you know how to do it.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Open the vhost configuration of your site and edit this line:</div>
<div></div>
<div><b>listen 443;</b></div>
<div><b> </b></div>
<div>change it into</div>
<div></div>
<div><b>listen 443 ssl;</b></div>
<div><b> </b></div>
<div>Now you're done!</div>
