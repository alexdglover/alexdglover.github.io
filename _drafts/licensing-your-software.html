<p>You've probably seen them in the applications you use - GPL v3, BSD, Apache License v2, OSI/OSD. These are all open source license options, but they are very different from one another.</p>
<p>So if you've written a piece of software, which one should you use? Let's go over some of the pros and cons of a few different licensing options.</p>
<h3>GNU Public License (GPL) V3</h3>
<p>Easily one of the most well known open source licenses, you'll often see GPL associated with Linux distributions as well as many Linux packages, RPMs, utilities, and the like. <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html" target="_blank">Here's the full text of the license.</a> Here are some of the key points:</p>
<ul>
<li>The GPL protects you (within reason) from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tort" target="_blank">tort lawsuits</a> by declaring that the product is provided with no warranty, expressed or implied.</li>
<li>You can give your product away for free or for a fee under the GPL BUT</li>
<li>Whoever you sell it to is also subject to the terms, meaning they have the right to distribute it for free (or for a fee) without giving you any of the proceeds</li>
<li>Allows you, as the author, to copyright your code (which future distributors must include) and gives you all of the protection that goes along with copyright law</li>
<li>The software cannot be patented, unless altered</li>
<li>If you create or modify software covered by the GPL, then you are obligated to make it available. The idea here is that if you improve the software, that improvement should be made available to everyone else. Of course, this doesn't mean you have to provide it for free, but you couldn't patent it and shouldn't withhold the information for business value. Some people argue that this is why many open source applications aren't used at the enterprise level, because large companies don't have the incentive to expand on the application.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you really want your application to be free forever, use the GPL. If your application can cure cancer, and you want to squeeze the world for every dime, don't use the GPL.</p>
<p>If you do want to use the GPL, simply include this text at the top of each of your source files (taken from gnu.org):</p>
