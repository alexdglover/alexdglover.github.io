<p>OK - I've been spending the last few hours getting acquainted with the WordPress backend (that sounds more risque than I had intended) and making my first custom 'child' theme.</p>
<p>If you have an interest in making custom themes and you're just getting started, I've got a few very generic tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don't underestimate how complex some of the themes and frameworks can be</li>
<li>Start by creating a child theme or modifying an existing theme</li>
<li>Check out <a href="http://www.presscoders.com/wordpress-theme-customization-guide/" target="_blank">this tutorial on PressCoders</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The tutorial on PressCoders is very clear, so I won't re-invent the wheel and write a tutorial on making child themes. Instead, I wanted to share the child theme that I made. Basically, I've taken the Twenty Eleven theme and replaced the static header image with a dynamic image slider (using <a href="http://galleria.io/" target="_blank">Galleria</a>). Here's a quick screenshot:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="{{ "/assets/twentyeleven_slider_preview.png" | absolute_url }}"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-360" alt="alexdglover_twentyeleven_slider" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/twentyeleven_slider_preview.png" width="595" height="432" /></a></p>
<p>Anyways, as simple as it is, I've learned a lot from the exercise. If you want to use the theme or take a look at the code, check out the <a href="https://github.com/alexdglover/ubiquitous-lamp">GitHub repo</a>. </p>
