This one's a short read, as most of the code and the concept was adopted from
the [jQuery Raptorize plugin](http://zurb.com/playground/jquery-raptorize).
Basically, I was admiring the Raptorize plug-in and thought how funny it would be
to have Dennis Nedry pop up and deliver his famous line, "Ah ah ah, you didn't
say the magic word!" whenever you had a failed login. Thanks to the jQuery Raptorize
plugin, the majority of the work was done. I just needed a picture of Dennis Nedry,
an mp3 file for the audio, and tweak the code slightly. Then I put together a
fake login page to demo the whole thing.

This was a quick 1-2 hour kind of project that I did a long time ago and just never
wrote a blog post for it. Hoping you got a quick laugh out of this post, let me
know if any of you actually deploy it somewhere!
