<p>I'll keep this short since it's not a proper how-to post or lengthy tutorial. I recently discovered a resurgence in the concept of HTML resumes and was thoroughly impressed. As always, I recklessly decided I should take a stab at it myself even though I knew I was out of my depth. Ended up with a half-decent HTML5/responsive/mobile-friendly resume using Bootstrap 2.3 and wanted to share it with the masses. Check out the demo and if you want to build on it, grab the source. Enjoy.</p>
